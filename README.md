###Hi, I’m Amir.
I’m building high-performance developer tools for JavaScript, starting with ⚡ Ruff ⚡, an extremely fast Python linter and code transformation toolchain written in Rust.

My goal is to make the Python ecosystem more productive by building faster developer tools.

I was most recently a staff software engineer at Spring Discovery. Before that, I was a senior software engineer at Khan Academy.
